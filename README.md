## Exploring-Factors-Influencing-Sustainable-Agriculture-Zero-Hunger-Data-As-A-Study-Case

## Objective: 
In this research project, I aim to analyze the factors influencing the indicator of the Sustainable Development Goals related to "Zero Hunger," which focuses on ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. I will consider countries and years as observations to understand what drives this indicator's variation.


### Research Question 1:
What are the key factors that influence the indicator of sustainable development goals related to "Zero Hunger," and how do these factors vary across different countries and years?

### Research Question 2: 
How does the prevalence of obesity (BMI equal to or greater than 30) relate to the indicator of "Zero Hunger," and what insights can be gained from analyzing their correlations?

### Research Question 3: 
To what extent do government actions and policies, particularly those related to population, education, and health, influence the progress toward achieving "Zero Hunger" as a sustainable development goal?

### Research Question 4: 
Are there any notable trends or patterns in the relationship between undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and agricultural productivity in different regions and over time?

### Research Question 5: 
How can machine learning methods, such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and neural networks, be applied to predict and understand the factors contributing to progress or setbacks in achieving "Zero Hunger" across countries and years?

### Research Question 6: 
What are the most significant observable variables that contribute to the prediction accuracy of machine learning models in assessing progress toward "Zero Hunger"?

### Research Question 7: 
How can the insights gained from analyzing the dataset contribute to the development of strategies to address the rising challenges of undernourishment and obesity worldwide, particularly in the context of environmental sustainability and climate change?


## Methodology:

Step 1: Data Preparation:

Import the dataset containing information about countries, years, and the "Zero Hunger" indicator.
Clean the data by addressing missing values or inconsistencies.

Step 2: Feature Selection:

Identify a set of observable variables (features) that I believe may have a significant impact on the "Zero Hunger" indicator based on my research questions.

Step 3: Data Analysis:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the relationships between the selected features and the "Zero Hunger" indicator.
Utilize data visualization techniques to visually represent these relationships.

Step 4: Machine Learning Methods:

Apply at least three machine learning methods to predict and interpret the factors influencing the "Zero Hunger" indicator. I'll use R programming and common machine learning methods such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

Step 5: Model Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate the performance of each machine learning method.
Utilize metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess model performance.

Step 6: Identifying Important Variables:

Analyze feature importance or coefficients for each machine learning method to identify the most influential observable variables that affect the "Zero Hunger" indicator.
